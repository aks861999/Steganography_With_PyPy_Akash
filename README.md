# Steganography_With_Python
Given any image file input.png,You should hide a QR code in it, not visible to naked eyes, and generate the image file output as output.png, where the QR code image is generated by the program using the secret code user input (secret code can be any random string of length 6-14 example "my_secret"). Then to write another program to extract the QR code from the image.

First of all we need to understand 'Image' is nothing but combination of numerous array.The dimension of the array obviously depends of the type of pixel in the image, if the picture is grayscale, indexed, or [binary image](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-digital-image-is-a-2D-array-of-pixels-Each-pixel-is-characterised-by-its-x-y_fig1_221918148) is 2D. A true color, [RGB image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_image) is 3D. This concept is very crucial in every step while analysing an 'image' file.

## Generate QR code if given a secret code

Let's generate a QR code to embed a secured message in it. To do that you need to first understand what exactly is a QR code. [QR code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) is a type of matrix barcode that is machine readable optical label which contains information about the item to which it is attached. In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application, etc.

First you need to install [qrcode](https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/) and [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) libraries.

```
pip install opencv-python qrcode
```
import the required module
```
import qrcode
```
Now set a object called data to be hidden in QR Code 
```
#data = "https://bytescare.com/"
data = input("Please enter the Security Code")
```
Set output file name 
```
filename = "site.png"
```
Generate qr code  and Build an Image type object
```
img = qrcode.make(data)
```
save image to a file in the same directory 
```
img.save(filename)
```

Here is the generated image of QR Code ![sample](https://github.com/aks861999/Steganography_With_PyPy_Akash/blob/master/site%20(1).png)

## Image Steganography
### Hiding QR code in the image of your choice
#### Encoding

[Image Steganography](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/image-steganography-in-cryptography/) is the process of hiding secret data in some image. In this post, we will hide one image inside another and convert it into another image and then extract back both the images from the previous image.

The idea behind image-based Steganography is very simple. Images are composed of digital data (pixels), which describes whatâ€™s inside the picture, usually the colors of all the pixels. Since we know every image is made up of pixels and every pixel contains 3-values (red, green, blue).

For example, suppose we have to hide img2 in img1, where both img1 and img2 are numpy nd array of pixel values. The size of img2 must be less than the size of img1. We are using color images, hence both will have 3 values (red, green, blue). Each pixel value varies from 0 to 255, so each pixel value is of 1 byte or 8 bits. Let img[i][j][l] be the pixel value at location (i, j) and of channel l where i varies from 0 to width and j varies from 0 to height and l varies from 0 to 2.

```import cv2 
import numpy as np 
import random 
  
  
# Encryption function 
def encrypt(): 
      
    # img1 and img2 are the 
    # two input images 
    img1 = cv2.imread('pic1.jpg') 
    img2 = cv2.imread('pic2.jpg') 

```

#### Decoding
Let img[i][j][l] be the pixel value of the image. Let v1 be 8 bits binary representation of img[i][j][l]. Let v2=v1[:4]+4 random bits and v3=v1[4:]+4 random bits. Then we assign img1[i][j][l] to v2 and img2[i][j][l] to v3.
